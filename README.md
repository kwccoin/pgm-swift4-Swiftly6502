# Swiftly6502
6502 emulator in swift

I used the JS implementation as the initial goal (achieved)

Project runs on iOS and probably OS X

Has the potential to be largely extended by abusing how bytes are emulated (actually an Int array in swift) 

Updated to Swift 4 by Uwe Falck

// kwc need to change some minor issues

// 1. logic wise press start two time will have issues and hang

// 2. other just have to update for Swift5/Xcode15/...

// 3. one var change to let
